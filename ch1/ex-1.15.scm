;; a. p is applied 5 times:

(p (p (p (p (p (sine 0.05))))))
(p (p (p (p (p 0.05)))))

;; b. the order of growth in number of steps is log-base-3(a),
;; since the input is divided by three at each step
;; the order of growth in space is also log-base-3(a) since at each
;; division by 3 there is a call to p
