notes from the video lecture

@24:24

"We say that a variable, v, is "bound in an expression", E, if the meaning of E is
unchanged by the uniform replacement of a variable w, not occurring in E, for every
occurence of v in E.

@29:11

"We say that a variable, v, is "free in an expression" E if the meaning of E is changed
by the uniform replacement of a variable w, not occurring in E for every occurrence of 
V in E."

(lamnda (x) (* x y))

X is bound and Y is free

@31:21

"If X is a bound variable in E then there is a lambda expression where it is bound. We
call the list of formal parameters of the lambda expression the "bound variable list"
and we say that the lambda expression "binds" the variables "declared" in its bound 
variable list. In addition, those parts of the expression where a variable has a value
defined by the lambda expression which binds it is called the "scope" of the variable."
