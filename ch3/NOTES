Chapter 3 Modularity, Objects, and State

3.1 Write a procedure make-accumulator that generates accumulators.

3.2 Write a procedure make-monitored that takes as input a procedure, f, that itself
takes one input and returns a third procedure, say mf, that keeps track of the number 
of times it has been called. If the input is the symbol how-many-calls, it returns the value of the counter; if the input is the symbol reset-count, it resets the counter.
