that attempting to compute square roots by naively finding a
fixed point of <em>y</em> <img src="book-Z-G-D-17.gif" border="0"><em>x</em>/<em>y</em> does not converge, and that this can be

Unfortunately, the process does not work for <a name="%_idx_1238"></a><a name="%_idx_1240"></a>fourth roots -- a single

a procedure <tt>drop</tt> that accomplishes this for the tower described

a complex number would involve throwing away the imaginary part.  Then
a number can be dropped if, when we <tt>project</tt> it and <tt>raise</tt>

true for points (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) in the region and false for points not in the

3 centered at (5, 7) is described by the predicate that tests
whether (<em>x</em> - 5)<sup>2</sup>  +  (<em>y</em> - 7)<sup>2</sup><u>&lt;</u> 3<sup>2</sup>.  To estimate the area of the

that contains the region.  For example, a rectangle with diagonally
opposite corners at (2, 4) and (8, 10) contains the circle above.
The desired integral is the area of that portion of the rectangle that
lies in the region.  We can estimate the integral by picking, at
random, points (<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>) that lie in the rectangle, and testing <em>P</em>(<em>x</em>,
<em>y</em>) for each point to determine whether the point lies in the region.
If we try this with many points, then the fraction of points that fall
in the region should give an estimate of the proportion of the
rectangle that lies in the region.  Hence, multiplying this fraction
by the area of the entire rectangle should produce an estimate of the

enables a procedure to record, in a local table, values that have

in the performance of a program.  A memoized procedure maintains a
table in which values of previous calls are stored
using as keys the arguments that produced the values.  When the
memoized procedure is asked to compute a value, it first checks the
table to see if the value is already there and, if so, just returns
that value.  Otherwise, it computes the new value in the ordinary way
and stores this in the table.  As an example of memoization, recall

that the calls to <tt>protected</tt> are done outside the <tt>dispatch</tt>

define a way to say that one pair of integers is ``less than''
another.  One way to do this is to define a ``weighting function''

Ordered streams of pairs provide an elegant solution to the problem of

<b>Exercise 4.40.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the multiple dwelling problem, how many sets of assignments are
there of people to floors, both before and after the requirement that
floor assignments be distinct?  It is very inefficient to generate all
possible assignments of people to floors and then leave it to
backtracking to eliminate them.  For example, most of the restrictions
depend on only one or two of the person-floor variables, and can thus
be imposed before floors have been selected for all the people.
Write and demonstrate a much more efficient
nondeterministic procedure that solves this problem based upon
generating only those possibilities that are not already ruled out by
previous restrictions.  (Hint: This will require a nest of <tt>let</tt>

but it is not clever at all when it comes to compiling calls to the primitive
procedures of the language in terms of the primitive operations
supplied by the machine.  For example, consider how much code is
compiled to compute <tt>(+ a 1)</tt>: The code sets up an argument list
in <tt>argl</tt>, puts the primitive addition procedure (which it finds
by looking up the symbol <tt>+</tt> in the environment) into <tt>proc</tt>,
and tests whether the procedure is primitive or compound.  The
compiler always generates code to perform the test, as well as code
for primitive and compound branches (only one of which will be executed).
We have not shown the part of the controller that implements
primitives, but we presume that these instructions make use of
primitive arithmetic operations in the machine's data paths.  Consider
how much less code would be generated if the compiler could <em>open-code</em> primitives -- that is, if it could generate code to directly
use these primitive machine operations.  The expression <tt>(+ a 1)</tt>

<b>Exercise 5.47.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;This section described how to modify the explicit-control evaluator so

modify the compiler so that compiled procedures can call not only
primitive procedures and compiled procedures, but interpreted
procedures as well.  This requires modifying <tt>compile-procedure-call</tt>
to handle the case of compound (interpreted) procedures.
Be sure to handle all the same <tt>target</tt> and <tt>linkage</tt> combinations
as in <tt>compile-proc-appl</tt>.  To do the actual procedure application,
the code needs to jump to the evaluator's <tt>compound-apply</tt> entry point.
This label cannot be directly referenced in object code
(since the assembler requires that all labels referenced by the
code it is assembling be defined there), so we will add a register
called <tt>compapp</tt> to the evaluator machine to hold this
entry point, and add an instruction to initialize it:

<b>Exercise 5.48.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="%_idx_6514"></a>The <tt>compile-and-go</tt> interface implemented in this section is

<b>Exercise 5.49.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;As an alternative to using the explicit-control evaluator's
read-eval-print loop, design a register machine that performs a
read-compile-execute-print loop.  That is, the machine should run a
loop that reads an expression, compiles it, assembles and
executes the resulting code, and prints the result.  This is easy to
run in our simulated setup, since we can arrange to call the
procedures <tt>compile</tt> and <tt>assemble</tt> as ``register-machine
operations.''
